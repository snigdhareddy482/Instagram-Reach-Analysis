Reach is an Instagram metric that tells you the number of people who have seen your post. 
This is different from impressions, which measure the number of times your post has been viewed. So, if the same person sees your message three times, that will be considered three impressions. But each user is only counted once in reach, making it a more accurate way to measure how many people have seen your content.
