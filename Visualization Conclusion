• The impressions I get from the home section on Instagram shows how much my
posts reach my followers. Looking at the impressions from home, I can say it’s
hard to reach all my followers daily

• Hashtags are tools we use to categorize our posts on Instagram so that we can
reach more people based on the kind of content we are creating. Looking at
hashtag impressions shows that not all posts can be reached using hashtags, but
many new users can be reached from hashtags.

• The explore section of Instagram is the recommendation system of Instagram.
It recommends posts to the users based on their preferences and interests. By
looking at the impressions I have received from the explore section, I can say that
Instagram does not recommend our posts much to the users. Some posts have
received a good reach from the explore section, but it’s still very low compared
to the reach I receive from hashtags.

• So the from donut plot shows that almost 50 per cent of the reach is from my
followers, 38.1 per cent is from hashtags, 9.14 per cent is from the explore section,
and 3.01 per cent is from other sources.
