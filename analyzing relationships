• There is a linear relationship between the number of likes and the reach I got on
Instagram

• It looks like the number of comments we get on a post doesn’t affect its reach

• A more number of shares will result in a higher reach, but shares don’t affect the
reach of a post as much as likes do.

• There is a linear relationship between the number of times my post is saved and
the reach of my Instagram post.


• So we can say that more likes and saves will help you get more reach on Instagram.
The higher number of shares will also help you get more reach, but a low number
of shares will not affect your reach either.

• The relationship between profile visits and followers gained is also linear.
